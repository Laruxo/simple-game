# Node.js Game Challenge

Create simple 1 vs 1 online game using Node.js and WebSockets.

## Requirements

The game should have these screens:
 
* Matchmaking:
    * Match players with each other randomly.
    * Display average waiting time to match.
    * Should have "MATCH ME!" button. The user enters players pool only when this button is pressed.
* Game:
    * There are no game mechanics here: display "WIN IT" button in each game screen. A player who presses it first wins the match.
    * Display match results and offer possibility to enter matchmaking queue again.
    * Limit each match to 30 seconds from the server side.

Also:

* The game server needs to support multiple matches simultaneously.
* Write an README.md on how to configure and run your application.
* Bonus points for tests (back-end only).
* Think what happens when players disconnect during the match or while in the matchmaking queue.
